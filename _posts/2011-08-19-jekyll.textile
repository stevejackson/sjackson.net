So here we are: you're looking at my new site, built on {"Jekyll"}[https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll], the famed blogging platform for hackers. I'm sufficiently impressed. I'll skim over a bit of what I used to build this for anyone interested.

After doing the basic install, I set up a {"git repo"}[https://github.com/stevejackson/sjackson.net] to host my code. This is one of biggest appeals of Jekyll: you're not stuffing your blog posts into a database; they're saved conveniently in a readable, and writable, markdown format (of your choice) anywhere you'd like.

Next I threw together my go-to deployment hack: a rakefile or some other wrapper to wrap an rsync command.

{% highlight ruby %}
task :deploy do
  sh %{rsync -avz --delete _site/ myserver:/my/app/location/on/server/}
end

task :server do
  sh %{jekyll --server --auto}
end
{% endhighlight %}

Nice and easy, that's how we like it.

h2. This is some quick test text.
