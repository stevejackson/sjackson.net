title: HTML5 Canvas Mazery
date: September 11, 2011

I've been wanting a reason to fool around with CoffeeScript and the HTML5 Canvas element for quite awhile, so I finally did so yesterday and "created mazery":http://mazery.sjackson.net. It's a maze generation visualizer. It's purposely built with an inefficient algorithm (Hunt and Kill) simply so that I can show the cool traversal process visually.

I'm majorly impressed by CoffeeScript. You can "check out my code":http://github.com/stevejackson/mazery on github. Feel free to provide feedback on anything I'm not doing the CoffeeScript way.

I'll hopefully get around to adding some stuff to mazery as time goes by, such as a solver. We'll see!
