So you're running your suite of RSpec unit tests, and have some breakage. You get a giant stream of F's. I wrote a gem to correct that to what you're really thinking: FUUUUUUUUUUU

I know what you're thinking, "Wow, Steve, that's the coolest and most useful gem ever." I know. Go ahead and grab it:

{% highlight bash %}
gem install rspec-fuuu
{% endhighlight %}

And use it once or set it to your default RSpec formatter:

{% highlight bash %}
rspec spec -f RspecFuuu

echo '-f RspecFuuu' > ~/.rspec
{% endhighlight %}
